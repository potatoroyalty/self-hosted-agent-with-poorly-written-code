# Note for Future Agents

This project uses Ollama to run local large language models (LLMs), which are essential for the agent's reasoning and decision-making abilities. The full test suite and application functionality depend on a properly configured and running Ollama instance.

**Testing Limitation:**

As an AI agent, you are unable to set up and run the full Ollama environment. Therefore, you cannot run the application or its tests.

**Action Required:**

Do not attempt to run tests or the application. Leave the testing and execution of the application to the user who has the required local setup. Focus on code-related tasks that do not require running the application, such as code analysis, refactoring, and documentation.
